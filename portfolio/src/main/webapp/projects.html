				I pursue undergraduate research at the Biomedical Functional Imaging and
				Neuroengineering Laboratory
				<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/bme/helab/" target="_blank">
					(BFINL)
				</a>
				at Carnegie Mellon University. I work on a team that deals with
				brain computer interfaces (BCIs), specifically using EEG data to detect
				and utilize motor-related brain signals to move robotic arms. My main
				project at the lab is developing a custom MATLAB software package to
				stream and process EEG data taken from EEG hardware (amplifiers, caps) to
				perform BCI tasks.

				For my final project for an introductory CS course
				<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/" target="_blank">(15-112)</a>,
				I created a messaging application that allows users to
				secretly encode information such as texts and images within other images
				without visibly altering the host image, using a process called
				steganography. Created with python sockets and image processing libraries,
				Hide.me allows a user to send an image that as secret information
				encoded within and encrypt it with a password. On the other end,
				the recepient can enter a password to decrypt and extract the secret
				contents within the image. Here's a link to the

				I'm part of the Tartan Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
				<a href="https://tartanauv.com/team/" target="_blank">(TAUV)</a>
				team at the robotics club at CMU. We particpate in the annual RoboSub
				competition, where teams build autonmous submarines that perform a
				variety of tasks such as passing through gates, hitting target buoys, and
				dropping markers. I've worked on a couple of parts of the sub, including
				being the testing lead to get the sub ready electronically for testing
				(building/soldering) and collecting training data for our
				deep learning object detection model to detect buoys and gates. This past
				year I also worked on software for trajectory/path planning as well as
				mission planning with python and Robot Operating System

				For the Build18 competition at CMU, I was part of a team of 5 that built
				a mini autonomous car that used simultaneous localization and mapping
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_
                and_mapping" target="_blank">
					(SLAM)
				</a>
				to map and travel through unknown environements. The car was
				built with standard VEX robotics parts, and it used a Zed mini stereo
				camera, Rplidar 360 degree lidar, and a Jetson Xavier for compute power.
				I primarily worked on construction of the vehicle and lidar, working with
				Hector SLAM, a ROS package that performs SLAM with lidar. Here's a

				Also for Build18, I worked on a system to improve the package sorting and
				delivery process here at CMU. It uses a combination of computer vision
				with OpenCV, SQL, and LED indicators so that emplyees can scan a barcode,
				have it automatically entered in database, and light up an LED to the
				given postal bin to put in. When students come to pick up a package, they
				add themselves to a queue, and the bins will light up so the emplyee can
				go and pick it up for them. Here's a link to the

			<div class="card-text">
				Legolight is a cheap, easy-to-build, and mass-produceable
				lantern that aims to solve the need of cheap and efficient lighting in
				low income areas and refugee camps. It consists of a set of simple
				lasercut acrylic pieces and minimal electronics (LEDS and circuitboard)
				that can easily snap together. It can be constructed within 5 minutes and
				when mass produced can cost around $2 in parts. It functions as both a
				flashlight and as a lantern with a sliding mechanism.

			<div class="card-text">
				For TartanHacks 2019, I worked on an augmented reality chemistry lab
				with Unity and the Vuforia Engine, aimed towards providing science
				lab education to the under priveleged. The app uses a smartphone camera
				to transform normal every day objects into scientific equipment,
				including bunsen burners and beakers, allowing students to
				perform bunsen burner flame tests in AR. This project was a finalist
				for the hackathon and it won the Facebook Social Impact Award. Here is

			<div class="card-text">
				Mula is an app that uses sentiment analysis of news articles to predict
				future stock prices with a score given by the app. The stack includes
				Flutter for the front end and python flask for the back end. This was
				definitely a cool project for PennApps 2019, as my team and I used
				various stock and trading APIs to accomplish this. This won the
				Goldman Sachs Financial Hack award. Here is a link to the

			<div class="card-text">
				As part of SteelHacks 2019, I developed Build.me, a a mixed reality
				system that allows engineers and designers to build and create 3D
				models using the power of your own two hands. Built with Unity, Vuforia,
				and Leap Motion, Build.me is an artificial environment where users can
				effortlessly create, rotate, scale objects, and more with hand
				motions and voice commands. They can save and view their designs in
				augmented reality with the vuforia engine as well. Our team won 4th
				place overall with this project. Here is a link to the

			<div class="card-text">
				For Hack This. Help Kids. 2018, Med.me sought to simplify the patient
				medical history process by directly connecting pedriatic patients to
				doctors through a simple app that works on a QR code system. Patients can
				enter their medical history in the application which would be securely
				stored in a medical database, and doctors can simply scan the QR code in
				the patients app to automatically enter that into that respective clinic
				or hospitals system. This aims to solve the problems of habing to fill
				out form after form every time you visit the doctor's office. The app was
				developed python flask, google cloud, and react native, and was a finalist
				for the hackathon. Here is a link to the

				This was my first hackathon! It was my first time with android app
				development. Trail Trak is an app where hikers and runners can alert each
				other about trail conditions and hazards. Built with android studio and
				the google maps API, Trail Trak allows users to pin locations on a map
				with a the condition of a trail, which can then be accessed later on for
				use by other people. This project was second place for the Bloomberg
				Social Good award. Here is the link to the

				For Hack 112, a hackathon for my intro to CS class, I developed an app
